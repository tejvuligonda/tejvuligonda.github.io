				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>Hi there, thanks for stumbling upon my website.</p>
				<p>I am a recent graduate from UCI. I graduated in September 2017 with a double major Computer Science & Engineering and Business Economics along with a minor in Management. </p>
				<p>I am interested in how technology can enable businesses to grow and succeed. I am also interested in application development with iOS, Android and the web. I am interested in full-stack development, Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. If you would like to work with me, feel free to contact me. </p>
				<p>Listed below are some of the positions I've held in the past. Hope you enjoy!</p>

						<h4><strong>Software Engineer </strong>Cisco Systems</h4>
						<span class="lieu">San Jose, California</span></br>
						<span class="dates">July 2017 - Present</span>
						<p>At Cisco, I am a software engineer working on the internal database team. My role is to developing automation, analytics and predictive tools. For example, I collaborated with the UI/UX team to develop a Database Portal consolidating 100+ tools with JavaScript, AngularJS, Node.js, and Oracle Apex, decreasing search time by 86%. The process to find the right tool would take about 35 minutes and it was brought down to an average of 5 minutes with this new tool. I also built a preemptive patching tool to scrape internal and external knowledge bases for database administrators to apply solutions before issues arise allowing for a process that is 93% faster than the manual process using Python, Beautiful Soup, JavaScript and AngularJS.</p>

						<h4><strong>Advanced Development Intern </strong>Dell EMC</h4>
						<span class="lieu">Irvine, California</span></br>
						<span class="dates">June 2016 - January 2017</span>
						<p>At my time at EMC (which was acquired by Dell), I worked on updating legacy code for a Performance Testing Automation Framework. The previous code was developed by a QA Engineer who no longer worked there. I worked with LAMP Stack, PHP and Perl scripting and helped decrease memory usage by 50%. I also developed scripts that automated the newest build of the product on the test sytem. I thorougly documented all of work because as an Advanced Development team member, I had to transition my work to the Release Engineering Team. Advanced Development works on new and upcoming products; the team pitches their ideas to the CTO who approves them and if they are accpted, a prototype of the product is built. When the prototype is finished, it is handed off to engineering to complete.</p>

						<h4><strong>Software/QA Intern </strong>Broadcom Corporation</h4>
						<span class="lieu">Irvine, California</span></br>
						<span class="dates">January 2016 - June 2016</span>
						<p>At my time at Broadcom, I worked with the Ethernet Controller Quality Assurance Team. Some of them include working with Python scripts to automate Ethernet Controller Testing.  I also implemented Bash scripts to install both Linux and Windows flavors of Server Operating Systems. Finally, I collaborated with the development team to create more efficient and secure programs. Some examples of security that I added were updating storing passwords in plaintext and applying a cryptographic hash to those passwords.</p>

						<h4><strong>Lab Automation and QA Test Intern</strong> QLogic Corporation</h4>
						<span class="lieu">Irvine, California</span></br>
						<span class="dates">June 2015 - October 2015</span>
						<p>A quick summary of what I did last summer at QLogic is I developed a Lab Asset Management system using Python, CGI scripting, and Django/Apache. I developed a program using Python and it's built-in SQLite library to automate tasks and query a database populated by a free-ware tool called SpiceWorks which held all of the information on devices in the lab. Some of the tasks that were automated included inventory audits, equipment scheduling, infrastructure planning, and IP allocations. I also included search functionality as well as filtering by asset type, location and name.</p>

						<h4><strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> QLogic Corporation</h4>
						<span class="lieu">Aliso Viejo, California</span></br>
						<span class="dates">June 2014 - September 2015</span>
						<p>Two summers ago, I interned at the corporate branch of QLogic on the Software Engineering team. Some of the highlights of my work there include developing C++ code for a testing management system, testing different network protocols, and remodeling the lab.</p>

						<span class="lieu">June 2016 to September 2016</span>
						<span class="dates"></span>
						<p>Professor Pai H Chou, the CSE Steering Committee Chair, was developing a website for the Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) students at UCI. I took the initiative to contact him about helping to develop the site and he gave me full responsibility to create the site. I worked with Drupal, a content management system to create a responsive site that includes a calendar, a forum, information about the major and even information on different resources that UCI has to offer to CSE students.</p>

						<h4><strong></strong>The Revitalization of the Anteater Express iOS App</h4>
						<span class="lieu">November 2015 to June 2016</span>
						<span class="dates"></span>
						<p>At my time at UC Irvine, I have been involved with student government more commonly known as ASUCI. In Fall of 2015, I was elected to be the representative for the School of Information & Computer Science (ICS) on ASUCI’s Senate. The Anteater Express, UC Irvine’s shuttle system, had a very outdated app targeted for iOS 6 and written in Objective-C. I took it upon myself as the ICS Senator to approach the administration to see how Computer Science students could help revitalize this app. They were pleased that I took initiative to find ways to make the school better and went for the idea. After getting the approval from the Director of Information Systems, I took to the time to find talented Computer Science students interested in helping with this endeavor. We have now completed revitalizing this application and have written it in Swift targeted at iOS 8. I am currently in the process of moving on to renovating the Anteater Express Android application.</p>
